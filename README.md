## Bitcoin Wallet

Online Bitcoin Cash wallets often have one or two annoying idiosyncrasies, like demanding mandatory 2-FA, and there's nothing you can do about it.

It's also not clear what information they collect. Besides, sometimes you just need a simple wallet.

So I made The Simplest Bitcoin Wallet :)

Mostly for myself, but maybe somebody will find it useful too.

Please help test it, if you have a spare minute.
